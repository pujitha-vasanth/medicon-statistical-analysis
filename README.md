# Statistical Analysis For A Batch of Medicon COVID Vaccines 
Medicon, a pharmaceutical company, has manufactured the sixth batch (40,000 units) of COVID-19 vaccine doses. This vaccine was clinically tested last quarter and around 200,000 doses have already been given to people in five batches.

Now, the sixth batch of doses needs to be tested for their time of effect (measured as the time taken for the dose to be absorbed in the body for its COVID-19 preventative effects, such as antibody creation, to manifest), as well as for quality assurance (which tells you whether the dose will be able to do a satisfactory job or not).

I am working with the quality assurance team of Medicon and want to understand the quality of the sixth batch so that the company can plan for the next batch of doses.

The previous analysis found that a dose is ten times more likely to produce a satisfactory result than not. I will solve 3 problems statistically, one by one.
